# Overview

As an aspiring software engineer, I am dedicated to expanding my proficiency in systems-level programming. My goal with this project was to figure out a new programming language, Rust in this case. By building this generator, I am deepening my understanding of programming in general and testing out basic Rust capabilities.
The software is a Fibonacci Sequence Generator built in Rust. It captures user input from the terminal, validates that the input is a positive integer, and then generates the Fibonacci sequence up to that number. The core logic is decoupled into a specialized function that leverages mutable references to populate a dynamic data structure. To demonstrate advanced memory handling, the program also provides a "snapshot" of the data using memory slicing.
My purpose for writing this software was to apply the core pillars of Rust: Ownership, Borrowing, and Pattern Matching. I wanted to see how the language handles common programming tasks—like looping and variable mutation—while strictly enforcing safety rules at compile time.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
